One-Page Checklist: Social Media That Fills Pubs

Goal
- Every post drives a clear action: book, call, directions, RSVP.

4-Step Post Check (use for every post)
- Goal + Call to Action: Define the single action you want.
- Image/Video: One bright, clear shot (people > plates; daylight > flash).
- Caption Hook: Lead with the strongest detail, then the ask.
- Timing: Post when guests decide (lunch, after work, weekend mornings).

Cadence
- Facebook: 3–5x/week — events, specials, community updates.
- Instagram: 3–5x/week — grid photos, Reels (vibe), Stories (daily moments).
- Google Business Profile: Weekly updates + review replies within 48 hours.

Content Pillars (rotate weekly)
- Events & Live Sport
- Food & Drink Heroes
- People & Place
- Offers & Moments
- Community & Causes

Channel Cheat Sheets
- Facebook
  - Do: Create Events; post specials/local moments with clear calls to action; pin offers; apply approved brand lockup where helpful.
  - Don’t: Walls of flyers; long text without a hook; endless third‑party links.
  - Setup: Correct hours; “Call Now” button; menu/booking link; messaging on.
- Instagram
  - Do: Atmosphere and people; Reels for vibe; Stories daily; location tag + a clear call to action; apply approved brand lockup where helpful.
  - Don’t: Over-filters; dark food shots; text‑heavy tiles; posting without a next step.
  - Setup: Bio with a clear call to action and a link tool; highlights for menu/events; consistent location tags.
- Google Business Profile
  - Do: Keep hours/menu/phone accurate; add weekly photos; post Updates; reply to reviews.
  - Don’t: Outdated info; ignore reviews; low‑res photos.
  - Setup: Booking/call buttons; correct category/attributes; holiday hours set.

Caption Prompts (pick one and add a clear call to action)

Call-to-Action Starters

- Get directions → [map link]
- Add to calendar → [Facebook Event]
- RSVP on Facebook → [Event link]

Quick Audit (weekly)
- Google Business Profile current? (hours, menu, photos) | Reviews replied?
- 3 Facebook + 3 Instagram posts this week? Each with a clear call to action?
- Photos bright and in‑focus? People featured?
- Next week scheduled?

De‑prioritise (until basics are solid)
- X/Twitter: Needs high frequency; low local ROI for most pubs.
- TikTok: High creativity/time cost; optional if resource and clear concept.

Compliance Tone
- Celebrate experience, food, community. Avoid glorifying excessive drinking.
