Title: Social Media That Fills Pubs
Host: Orange Jelly for Greene King
Format: Online, recorded (Greene King Training Team to organise)
Date: Tue 24 Sep
Duration: 30 minutes (20 min content, 10 min Q&A)

Assets
- Logos: `Presentation/orange-jelly-logo.png` (added) and `Presentation/greene-king-logo.png` (place here; exact filename as shown).
- Slides file: `Presentation/workshop-presentation.html`

Objective
- Outcome: Tenants review and improve how they use social to bring people into their pubs.
- Success Measure: Attendees publish or schedule at least 3 improved posts in the following week, each with a clear call to action and aligned to best practices.

Audience
- Mixed experience: from little/no experience to more confident operators.
- Pub types: mix of wet-led/food-led; urban/rural.

Platform Focus
- Primary: Facebook, Instagram, Google Business Profile.
- De‑prioritise/avoid (why): X/Twitter (needs high posting volume for returns); TikTok (high creativity/time cost, not essential for most pubs to drive footfall).

Core Content (20 min)
- Channel roles: What each platform is for and what to avoid on each.
- Best practices: Recommended posting cadence and timing; simple content pillars for pubs.
- Creatives: Quick ways to capture quality photos/video; brand‑safe visuals.
- Branding: When and how to apply the Greene King/Orange Jelly brand lockup for recognition (safe margins, contrast, unobtrusive placement).
- Copywriting: Hooks, offers, events; always include a clear call to action.
- Guest journey: Define the desired action per post (book, call, directions, RSVP) and how to drive to conversion.
- Compliance tone: Be considerate; avoid glorifying excessive drinking; keep it engaging and fun.
- Maturity scale: Crawl→Walk→Run stages with time investment guidance; placed after Cadence + Pillars to guide where to focus next.

Recommended Posting Cadence
- Facebook: 3–5x/week — events, menus, community updates, specials.
- Instagram: 3–5x/week — visual highlights, reels for atmosphere, stories for daily moments.
- Google Business Profile: Weekly updates; keep hours/menus/events/photos current; respond to reviews.

What to Avoid
- Generic posts without a clear call to action or clear outcome.
- Low‑quality visuals (dark, blurry, off‑brand).
- Over‑promotion of drinking; focus on experience, food, events, community.
- Platform misfit: don’t spread thin on X/TikTok until the basics are solid.

Interaction (10 min)
- Live Q&A; quick diagnostics on attendee examples if time allows.

Takeaways
- One‑pager: Checklist with posting schedule, content pillars, call‑to‑action prompts, and example captions.
- Mini templates: 3 caption formulas and 5 content ideas per platform.
